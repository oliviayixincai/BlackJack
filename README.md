# BlackJack

This is a Blackjack game written in Java using Greenfoot IDE to simulate gameplay mechanics.

The player's goal is to keep the cards close to, but not greater
than 21. The king, queen, jack and ten count as ten points; An ace
can count as either 1 or an 11. If you get A and T (in any order),
you get blackjack. If the player is blackjack and the dealer is other,
the player wins 1.5 times the bet; If both the dealer and the player
are  blackjack, they push. If only the dealer is blackjack, the dealer
wins. If the dealer's card is A, the player can buy Insurance, which
is half of the bet and non-refundable if the dealer has no blackjack.
If the dealer has blackjack, the player who bought the insurance gets
1.5 times the bet. Click “Hit” to get one more card. Click “Stand” to
keep the cards. Click“double down” to double the bets. If you surrender.
You will lose half of your bet right away.
